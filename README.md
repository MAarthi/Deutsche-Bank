## CSS Framework

Added Bootstrap as the styling framework

 ## How the Application Works 

    1) Select the Region - Asia or Europe 
    2) Based on the Region, Country will loaded fron the API
    3) Country details will be loaded in to the second drop down 
    4) Select the country fron the Country dropdown and click on Load Country button 
    5) This will dispaly the country details like name, capital, population, currencies, flag in the table 

## If you ran out of time what else you would have done.

    As i have not worked with NGRX, i have used services to cache the Europe and Asia countries. So only once the countries will be loaded from the API, upon second time it will be loaded from the service. 

    I would have implemented the same logic usign NGRX if i had more time.
